 LORD, MAN... WERE YE BUT WHYLES WHERE I AM, 
 THE GENTILES YE WAD NE'ER ENVY 'EM.        
 IT'S TRUE, THEY NEEDNA STARVE OR SWEAT,     
 THRO' WINTER'S CAULD OR SIMMER'S HEAT...  
 THEY'VE NAE SAIR WARK TO CRAZE THEIR BANES, 
 AND FILL AULD AGE WITH GRIPS AN' GRANES...  
                                             
 BUT HUMAN BODIES ARE SIC FOOLS              
 FOR A' THEIR COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS,           
 THAT WHEN NAE REAL ILLS PERPLEX THEM,       
 THEY MAK ENOW THEMSELVES TO VEX THEM,       
 AN' AYE THE LESS THEY HAE TO STURT THEM,    
 IN LIKE PROPORTION LESS WILL HURT THEM....
